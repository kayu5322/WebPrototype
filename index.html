                <p>What We do:</p>
                <p>
                    Asian Aid is an Christian, non- profit organization that is committed to minimize poverty by providing children with educational opportunities, promoting the comprehensive development of children and their communities in which they live by addressing social issues such as child rights, human trafficking, life skills and health education(AsianAid, 2019)

                    Asian Aid currently supports a number of local partners in Nepal, India and Bangladesh to facilitate improvements in the quality of primary, secondary and tertiary education for approximately 5,000 children in a number of formal and non- formal learning contexts. (Australian Government, 2020)

                    They place the wellbeing of deserving children in Asian the core of all that we do. By sponsoring a child, you empower us to help those children who are most vulnerable grow strong.  We empower them by equipping their families and communities with tools to help support them. Through education and resources, we provide children and their communities with the skills and resources they need to break the cycle of poverty.
                </p>
                <p>Our Goal:</p>
                <p>We strive to provide the children in our sponsorship program with:</p>
                <p>•	A holistic education that has the potential to empower them for life</p>
                <p>•	The means to achieve and maintain physical and emotional health</p>
                <p>•	The skills to ensure future economic stability</p>
                <p>
                    •	Opportunities to interact with others in a compassionate and considerate manner
                    (AsianAid, 2012)
